# My Reflection / Blog
Hi all, this week my screencast involved GitHub and Pull Requests. GitHub is a platform that allows for easy open source sharing and communication, and for the most part with code. To create this ease of collaboration, there is a feature known as Pull Requests. 
 
A Pull Request is created after someone makes a change to a particular branch of a repo. Once the change is proposed, the Pull Request is used to show the changes that are being suggested and allowing for users to discuss the changes and whether or not they will be merged into the the base branch. This is a great way to effectively collaborate on files, code, etc. because of the direct communication.
